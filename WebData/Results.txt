(a)
Single-family detached, attached, two-family, and three-family residential properties shall meet the following landscape requirements prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy and/or tree permit:
(1)
Minimum trees per lot. Each developed lot shall have shade or accent trees planted or retained as follows:
a.
Trees shall be provided/preserved pursuant to Table 138-3658.a—Minimum Trees Per Lot.
EXPAND
Table 138-3658.a — Minimum Trees Per Lot
Lot Size Minimum Required Trees per lot (1)
Less than 3,000 square feet  ■ 1 shade or accent tree
3,001 to 6,000 square feet  ■ 2 shade trees or accent trees (1, 2)
Between 6,001 to 9,500 square feet  ■ 4 shade trees or accent trees (1, 2)
Between 9,501 to 16,000 square feet  ■ 6 shade trees or accent trees (1, 2)
16,001 square feet or greater  ■ 8 shade trees or accent trees, (1, 2) PLUS

■ One additional tree is required for each 2,000 square feet, or portion thereof, in excess of 16,000 square feet
General Notes:
1. Shade trees shall be prioritized. Accent trees may only be used and counted towards the minimum trees per lot requirement when adequate planting space and/or light is greatly limited on the lot and would not allow for healthy shade tree growth. Accent trees planted in lieu of required shade trees shall be at a ratio of 2:1.
2. Fifty percent (50%) of lot requirement must be shade trees.
  b.
Each existing healthy tree with the following dbh measurement can be credited as specified:
EXPAND
1. 4" dbh-10" dbh - 1:1 shade tree credit
2. 10.1" dbh-20" dbh - 2:1 shade tree credit
3. 20.1" dbh-36" dbh - 3:1 shade tree credit
4. Over 36" dbh - 4:1 shade tree credit
  (2)
Existing vegetation. Existing vegetation shall be eligible to meet the requirements of this section. This shall not apply to any species listed as an undesirable tree.
(3)
Other permeable/unimproved areas. Permeable/unimproved portions of private property including required yards shall be maintained with an herbaceous layer of sod, ground cover plant material, organic mulch, synthetic turf, and/or gravel. Mulch and gravel shall be maintained so that material and sediment does not enter the public storm sewer system.
(4)
Organic mulch. Organic mulch is a beneficial addition to landscaping in many situations including, but not limited to, providing a surface covering under shrubs, or where groundcover material is maturing. The intention of these regulations is to allow mulch within a landscape while not allowing the entire yard to only be covered in mulch.
a.
Installation standards. Where used in lieu of sod or groundcover plant material, organic mulch shall be placed to a minimum depth of three inches. The top level of mulch shall not exceed the height of the immediately adjacent ground surface. Mulch shall not be placed directly against a plant stem or tree trunk. Non-organic groundcovers including decorative gravel or crushed stone shall be allowed only in planting areas (e.g., in gardens or hedge areas) and not as a substitute for sod, groundcover or organic mulch.
b.
Limits on installation. Organic mulch may be used without limit underneath shrubs and trees, provided the groundcover, shrubs, trees or a combination thereof are planted and maintained at a cumulative ratio of at least one plant or tree, planted per each 50 square feet of organic mulched area. Plants or trees are to be planted within the mulch.
c.
Limits on installation in rights-of-way. Organic mulch may be used in permeable areas of the right-of-way to keep moisture in the soil while other forms of approved groundcover plant material are maturing. Mulch is prohibited within four feet of the curb or edge of pavement, if there is no curb. Mulch in the right-of-way must be contained within borders sufficient to prevent flotation of mulch into the roadway. With the exception of permitted driveway or sidewalk materials, the use of shell, rock or other similar hardened non-organic surface materials in the right-of-way is prohibited.
(5)
Irrigation. Irrigation systems are not required.
(6)
Mobile home park lots. Individual lots in mobile home parks shall be required to plant one shade or accent tree. When determining replacement requirements for tree removal from individual lots in mobile home parks, required replacements shall not be required to be replaced on individual lots but shall be replaced into areas maintained by the park as a whole, such as common areas, buffer areas, and areas around retention ponds. Where a mobile home park does not wish to replace a tree, a fee in lieu of replacement shall be required.
(7)
Sight triangle. All landscaping shall comply with the provisions of section 138-3508, sight visibility triangles.
(b)
All required landscape material shall be provided on the subject site. The following alternatives may be allowed:
(1)
The required trees/shrubs may be planted within the abutting right-of-way when allowed by the roadway facility owner (i.e., local government, developer, or property owners association); AND/OR
(2)
The applicant may provide a monetary contribution up to 40 percent of the tree requirement to a formally-adopted tree mitigation fund at a rate established by the board of county commissioners; AND/OR
(3)
The county administrator or designee, may allow applicants to construct and maintain structures with plant material that provide similar shade and vegetation function as a tree, (e.g., arbors with vines, shrubs, or similar plant material.) In this alternative, the amount of required trees may be reduced based on a near equivalent shade/vegetation function of a tree.

(a)
Intent. The intent of this section is to ensure that appropriate landscaping occurs with development and redevelopment, recognizing the need for flexibility to accommodate unique situations and challenges of urban development. Where specimen trees exist on a site proposed for development, deference shall be given to preserving such trees as integral elements of the overall development. It is also recognized that in the most urban development types buildings may take precedence over tree preservation, other landscaping choices may be preferable to traditional street trees, and that landscaping trees are utilitarian in nature and therefore may need to be replaced more frequently.
(b)
Landscape areas. Landscaping is required within the three areas described below. (See DPH FBC Div. 5: Figure 138-4504.a) Landscape material may be planted anywhere within each of the landscape areas, as long as the minimum required amount is met within each area. All required plant material must comply with DPH FBC Div. 5: Table 138-4504.b: Minimum Plant Specification Requirements and DPH FBC Div. 5: Table 138-4504.a establishes acceptable species of shade trees, accent trees, and palm trees that may be utilized to meet minimum landscaping requirements of this section.
Figure 138-4504.a: Landscape Areas
When units or measurements determining the minimum amount of required landscaping results in a fractional amount, then such fraction equal to or greater than one-half must be rounded up to the next whole number.
(1)
Area #1—Site trees. A minimum of one shade tree must be planted for every 1,500 square feet of lot area, up to 50 percent of the total lot area (excluding any wetlands), in all districts. In the event of site constraints, up to 25 percent of the required shade trees may be replaced by accent or palm trees subject to approval by the code administrator. The amount and type will be determined during the site plan review process. When planned site improvements or existing site constraints make required planting too difficult, the applicant shall contribute to the county tree bank as described in LDC section 166-57, at the discretion of the code administrator.
(2)
Area #2—Frontage landscaping.
a.
Requirement. A minimum of one accent tree and ten shrubs/plants/ornamental grasses must be planted per 50 linear feet along the site's frontage(s). This standard applies to all non-residential and multi-unit residential uses. Planting areas must be a minimum of five feet in width. Alternatively, trees may be permitted within appropriately sized tree wells, at the discretion of the code administrator. When planned site improvements or existing site constraints make required planting too difficult, the applicant shall contribute to the county tree bank as described in LDC section 166-57 at the discretion of the code administrator.
b.
Exceptions. Frontage landscaping is not required along portions of the site where the structure(s) sits closer than five feet to the front property line(s), however alternative use of fixed or movable planters, vines, greenery, etc. are encouraged to soften building facades.
c.
Allowances. Parking lot frontage landscaping, as described in DPH FBC Div. 6: section 138-4504(B)(3)(a) below, can satisfy the frontage landscaping requirements if the overall intent of this sub-section is met, as determined by the code administrator.
(3)
Area #3—Parking lot landscaping.
a.
Parking lot frontage landscaping. Any parking areas adjacent to or visible from a public street (excluding alleys) must be screened by one of the following methods. (See DPH FBC Div. 5: Figure 138-4504.b)
Figure 138-4504.b: Parking Lot Frontage Landscaping
1.
In the Central District a continuous, semi-opaque/opaque wall that compliments the building's design and style and is between three to four feet in height; or,
2.
A hedge row meeting the 'buffer plantings' standards established in DPH FBC Div. 5: Table 138-4504.b; or
3.
A combination of shade trees and shrubs that are evenly distributed along the parking lot frontage. Trees must not exceed 35 feet on center; or,
4.
Other methods may be allowed provided that the resulting situation adequately screens the parking area, as determined by the code administrator.
b.
Interior parking lot landscaping. Interior landscape islands must be provided within parking lots consisting of more than 20 parking spaces.
1.
Landscape islands with a surface area equal to five percent of the entire parking surface area must be provided.
2.
All required landscaped islands must be a minimum of 350 square feet in area, and must have a minimum of one shade tree per island. Appropriately sized tree wells shall be provided in lieu of islands, as determined by the code administrator.
(c)
Alternative landscaping plans. An alternative landscape plan, prepared by a licensed landscape architect, may be submitted for consideration as a Type 1B review in lieu of the minimum standards of this section. Evaluation and approval must be based upon meeting the overall intent of this section, as well as the intent of the district where it is proposed.
(d)
Existing tree preservation.
(1)
Existing non-invasive trees and native palms must be protected or replaced, when determined to be healthy by the applicable county staff or a certified arborist. Any impacts to protected trees must include mitigating actions such as replacement or relocation. Protected trees may count towards the minimum landscaping requirements, as stated in DPH FBC Div. 5: section 138-4504(a). Protected trees must include:
a.
Any existing healthy tree with a diameter breast height (DBH) of four inches or larger, measured at a height of four and one-half feet above the ground (undesirable tree species are exempt);
b.
All healthy sabal/cabbage palms six feet in height or larger;
c.
All buttonwood;
d.
All mangroves.
(2)
The tree removal/replacement standards established in LDC section 138-3654(a)(2)—(5) and Table 138-3654.a apply.
(3)
When replanting or relocation is not possible due to planned site improvements, as an alternative, the applicant shall contribute to the county tree bank as described in LDC section 166-57, or by integrating existing character defining/specimen trees into the proposed development, such alternative may be reviewed and approved at the discretion of the code administrator in consultation with development review services environmental staff.
(e)
Street trees. The planting and removal of street trees shall be as regulated in LDC section 138-3657.
(f)
Buffers. When buffering is required, per the DPH FBC, the property that triggers the requirement shall provide one of the following methods along the shared property line. Ingress/egress drives are permitted to intersect the buffer area.
(1)
A fence or wall per DPH FBC Div. 5: section 138-4501(a)(8).
(2)
A ten-foot wide landscape buffer yard that contains continuous plantings meeting the "Buffer Plantings" standards of DPH FBC Div. 5: Table 138-4504.a: Minimum Plant Specification Requirements; or
(3)
Other screening/buffering methods, including a combination of the above options, may be allowed, as determined by the code administrator.

(a)
Setbacks shall be measured pursuant to the following standards and situations:
(1)
Setbacks shall be measured by the shortest dimension, running from the property line perpendicular to the structure. No land below the shoreline shall be credited as a part of a required yard or setback.
(2)
No portion of an alley or ingress/egress easement shall be considered as a part of a required setback.
(3)
Residential corner lots and multiple-frontage lots shall be considered to have one front setback. For setback purposes, the front setback shall generally be applied to the frontage designated to bear the address, that has access from the street and the principal entrance to the building or the narrower of the two frontages.
a.
Side setback standards shall apply to all other sides of such a lot or parcel; except
b.
A rear setback shall apply to the property line that is opposite of the primary frontage.
c.
In cases where there is a frontage opposite of the primary frontage, a front setback shall apply to that opposite frontage. If the opposite front is not accessible, a rear setback may be applied.
(4)
Where right-of-way lines have been previously established by an action of the board of county commissioners for the purpose of future roads or widening of existing roads, all street setbacks shall be measured from the proposed right-of-way line.
(5)
Wing walls shall conform to the normal setback requirements whenever they exceed the allowable fence height.
(6)
Wherever a side or rear lot line in a commercial or industrial district abuts either a railroad right-of-way, a railroad siding tract, or a railroad easement, the side and rear setback requirements will not apply at the abutting side or rear line. Instead, a zero-foot setback for the construction of buildings will be permitted up to the abutting side or rear property line.
(7)
The portions of a lot that abut an alley or a designated public park or trail shall require a minimum setback of ten feet or as otherwise stated in this Code, whichever is greater.
(8)
All decks which exceed one foot above grade shall be considered as structures for the purpose of setback requirements in order to preclude encroachment and violation of privacy onto neighboring properties.
a.
This shall not include docks approved by the water and navigation authority.
b.
Where this situation does not exist, such as lots which abut natural areas or similar areas where there will be no such encroachment or violation of privacy, the county administrator may waive this provision and such deck shall not be considered as a structure for the purpose of meeting setback requirements.
c.
This provision, however, in no way precludes the application of other provisions such as habitat management requirements, easement restrictions or similar provisions regulating the location of such uses.
(b)
Setbacks standards shall include the following encroachments, allowances, and/or limitations:
(1)
Porches and decks are subject to the applicable district front building setback(s); some districts allow for a separate, reduced front setback for porches and decks. This reduced front setback standard is not applicable to carports and other covered parking structures unless approved as part of a development master plan or equivalent.
(2)
Sills, eaves, cornices, chimneys, flues and similar architectural projections may project into a setback area up to three feet, but at least a three-foot distance from the adjacent property line must be maintained.
(3)
Swimming pools shall have a minimum rear property setback, as measured from the water's edge of the pool, of eight feet or the minimum rear setback of the district, whichever is less.
(4)
Screen enclosures are permitted a side and rear property setback of five feet or the minimum rear or side setback of the district, whichever is less.
(5)
Swimming pools, as measured from the water's edge of the pool, and pool enclosures located on multi-frontage lots are subject to the applicable district side street and rear setbacks, respectively.
(6)
All residential structures, and their accessory structures, on waterfront lots or parcels shall be subject to the following setbacks limitations:
a.
Where no seawall is present, structures shall be set back 25 feet from the mean high-water mark in tidal areas or normal high water on lakes;
b.
Where adequate seawalls or riprap stabilization exist, the setback requirement shall be 15 feet from the midpoint of the seawall or riprap stabilization.
c.
Swimming pools without screen enclosures may be constructed pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, provided that, certification from an engineer registered in the state is submitted prior to issuance of a permit, verifying that the proposed structure will not affect the integrity or functioning of the seawall or its dead-men (underground support structures).
(7)
Arbors and pergolas 100 square feet or less in size are not subject to setback standards provided that site visibility standards are addressed through structure placement/design.
(8)
Other setback encroachments may be allowed to nonconforming situations pursuant to chapter 138, article II, division 6.
(9)
Mechanical equipment such as air conditioning units, pool equipment and optional standby and emergency generators should be placed adjacent to the structure and may encroach into the required setback up to three feet from the adjacent property line, however a minimum ten-foot separation shall be required from any residential structure on a neighboring property, excluding garages or other uninhabited spaces.
a.
Mandatory access points to elevated platforms housing mechanical equipment may also encroach into the required setback per the above standards. Mechanical equipment on raised platforms that encroach into the required setback shall be appropriately screened to shield noise.
b.
Mechanical equipment shall not encroach into a recorded easement unless authorized by the county and/or other easement holder.
(10)
Outside, unenclosed stairways may extend four feet into any required yard but not closer to any side lot line than a distance of five feet.
(c)
Setbacks standards for storage sheds apply as follows in residential districts:
(1)
For the purposes of this subsection and standards therein, storage sheds are described as stand-alone, non-inhabitable structures that are up to 200 square feet in size.

All storage sheds shall be designed in such a manner so that water runoff from the roof of the structure is not directed onto neighboring properties.
(6)
Storage sheds shall not be placed in the front yard between the main residence and the abutting street. Applicants may request a waiver to this standard where existing site conditions prevent the shed from being placed in other locations of the property.
(7)
Storage sheds may be permitted within an exterior side yard if screened with a six-foot high opaque fence.
(d)
Setbacks standards shall not supersede or allow easement encroachment. The following shall apply:
(1)
No portion of any structure shall be located within the area of a recorded public easement unless authorized by the county and/or other easement holder.

This section may be applied to all residential districts as a goal to create compatible and harmonious infill development and redevelopment in established residential neighborhoods. The setback and height requirements of residential districts may be administratively adjusted to allow development and redevelopment to occur in concert with abutting properties. In cases where properties exist in established residential neighborhoods, development of said properties may occur in such a way that is to be compatible with abutting lots in terms of setbacks and height adjustments.
(a)
The proposed infill development may conform to any standards required by valid recorded plats, deed restriction or approved valid site plans, to the extent provided by law; or
(b)
Where such documentation is not available, the setbacks of the proposed infill units shall be based upon the average setbacks of neighboring units. [Example: if a proposed infill lot abuts two single-family homes with front setbacks of ten feet and 20 feet, the proposed unit may be constructed with a minimum 15 feet front setback.] This standard shall be applied to the primary structure; accessory structures may not be used in determining the average setback.
(c)
When a primary structure is constructed using a reduced setback afforded by this section, the structural height shall be limited by the average stories/levels of the primary structures on the abutting properties, rounded to the highest story/level. In this case, a structure that utilizes the reduced setback shall be limited to such average stories/levels and may not necessarily be permitted the full building height of the district. In no case shall building height exceed the maximum for the district. This standard is intended to achieve compatible infill development.
(d)
The property owner may pursue the development flexibility afforded in this section by providing proper documentation to the applicable county reviewing department. Proper documentation may include official surveys, development plans, blueprints or other documentation as may be approved by the county administrator or designee.
Figure 138-399.(d). 1 — Residential Infill Standards:
Property "C" (infill lot) may be permitted a reduced front structural setback based on the average existing front setbacks of adjacent properties "A" and "B". The average setback of the adjacent properties shall be calculated as follows:
Existing Front Setback "A" + Existing Front Setback "B" / 2 = Allowed Front Setback "C"

Intent. The 'Neighborhood District' is predominately residential in appearance, but multi-use in function and serves to transition between the Central District and the primarily single-family residential areas outside of the Downtown Palm Harbor Activity Center. This District supports a mix of small to medium building types that allow more definition between public and private areas, as well as, small-scaled neighborhood and civic uses. District standards along Alternate U.S. 19 support the placement of community-scaled commercial uses.

(a)
Intent. The intent of this section is to ensure that appropriate landscaping occurs with development and redevelopment, recognizing the need for flexibility to accommodate unique situations and challenges of urban development. Where specimen trees exist on a site proposed for development, deference shall be given to preserving such trees as integral elements of the overall development. It is also recognized that in the most urban development types buildings may take precedence over tree preservation, other landscaping choices may be preferable to traditional street trees, and that landscaping trees are utilitarian in nature and therefore may need to be replaced more frequently.
(b)
Landscape areas. Landscaping is required within the three areas described below. (See DPH FBC Div. 5: Figure 138-4504.a) Landscape material may be planted anywhere within each of the landscape areas, as long as the minimum required amount is met within each area. All required plant material must comply with DPH FBC Div. 5: Table 138-4504.b: Minimum Plant Specification Requirements and DPH FBC Div. 5: Table 138-4504.a establishes acceptable species of shade trees, accent trees, and palm trees that may be utilized to meet minimum landscaping requirements of this section.
Figure 138-4504.a: Landscape Areas
When units or measurements determining the minimum amount of required landscaping results in a fractional amount, then such fraction equal to or greater than one-half must be rounded up to the next whole number.
(1)
Area #1—Site trees. A minimum of one shade tree must be planted for every 1,500 square feet of lot area, up to 50 percent of the total lot area (excluding any wetlands), in all districts. In the event of site constraints, up to 25 percent of the required shade trees may be replaced by accent or palm trees subject to approval by the code administrator. The amount and type will be determined during the site plan review process. When planned site improvements or existing site constraints make required planting too difficult, the applicant shall contribute to the county tree bank as described in LDC section 166-57, at the discretion of the code administrator.
(2)
Area #2—Frontage landscaping.
a.
Requirement. A minimum of one accent tree and ten shrubs/plants/ornamental grasses must be planted per 50 linear feet along the site's frontage(s). This standard applies to all non-residential and multi-unit residential uses. Planting areas must be a minimum of five feet in width. Alternatively, trees may be permitted within appropriately sized tree wells, at the discretion of the code administrator. When planned site improvements or existing site constraints make required planting too difficult, the applicant shall contribute to the county tree bank as described in LDC section 166-57 at the discretion of the code administrator.
b.
Exceptions. Frontage landscaping is not required along portions of the site where the structure(s) sits closer than five feet to the front property line(s), however alternative use of fixed or movable planters, vines, greenery, etc. are encouraged to soften building facades.
c.
Allowances. Parking lot frontage landscaping, as described in DPH FBC Div. 6: section 138-4504(B)(3)(a) below, can satisfy the frontage landscaping requirements if the overall intent of this sub-section is met, as determined by the code administrator.
(3)
Area #3—Parking lot landscaping.
a.
Parking lot frontage landscaping. Any parking areas adjacent to or visible from a public street (excluding alleys) must be screened by one of the following methods. (See DPH FBC Div. 5: Figure 138-4504.b)
Figure 138-4504.b: Parking Lot Frontage Landscaping
1.
In the Central District a continuous, semi-opaque/opaque wall that compliments the building's design and style and is between three to four feet in height; or,
2.
A hedge row meeting the 'buffer plantings' standards established in DPH FBC Div. 5: Table 138-4504.b; or
3.
A combination of shade trees and shrubs that are evenly distributed along the parking lot frontage. Trees must not exceed 35 feet on center; or,
4.
Other methods may be allowed provided that the resulting situation adequately screens the parking area, as determined by the code administrator.
b.
Interior parking lot landscaping. Interior landscape islands must be provided within parking lots consisting of more than 20 parking spaces.
1.

The purpose of this division is to preserve the existing natural environment and provide landscape improvements on private properties and public rights-of-way in order to promote a positive urban image, enhance property values, strengthen the fabric of the surrounding community, promote context-sensitive growth that recognizes land use and transportation goals, establish a harmonious relationship between the natural and built environment, and enhance the overall aesthetic quality of development in the county. The landscape regulations are intended to achieve the following objectives:
■
Conserve water by preserving existing established and native landscaping, encouraging the use of "Florida-friendly" and native trees, palms, shrubs, grasses, and ground covers, and establishing standards for the installation of landscape material and irrigation systems.
■
Reduce the visual impact of large building masses, paved surfaces and vehicular use areas.
■
Improve the appearance of unincorporated Pinellas County by creating quality urban environments that are sustainable over time.
■
Improve environmental quality through the use of low impact development (LID) techniques that will improve water quality, facilitate aquifer recharge and reduce stormwater runoff, and reduce "heat island" effects.
■
Increase land values by providing landscaping that will function as a capital asset.
■
Provide for safer and more pedestrian-friendly walking environments by forming and framing public spaces with trees which provide distinct edges to sidewalks so that motorists better distinguish between their environment and one shared with people.
■
Provide habitats for urban wildlife.
■
Protect native plant species and habitats by eliminating invasive exotic species that threaten the ecosystem.

The PC, Preservation/Conservation District regulates the use of properties having unique environmental, biological, or ecological features. The district provides criteria to protect areas containing endangered species of flora or fauna, preserve areas considered vital to the maintenance and recharge of water resources, preserve areas with unique or valuable topographic or subsurface features, protect areas of significant environmental or ecological importance to the county, protect areas of natural drainage, and ensure the least intensive development compatible with the protection of native plants, wildlife and habitats in their natural condition. These areas may consist of wetlands and/or uplands.
This district also supports environmental research and environmental education that is dependent on, or interprets, the surrounding natural environment, and is consistent with applicable management plans on county-owned or managed property. It is the intent of this section that all lands and water classified as PC shall remain in an essentially undeveloped state with no appreciable impervious surface coverage and with as much natural vegetation retained as possible, or in compliance with adopted management plans.
